####Contributing to zmNinja

The source code will always be available under CCSA-NC. If you'd like to contribute please know that if your changes are accepted and merged they will make it to the App/Play Store when I publish the app. This does not entitle you to any renumeration - If you still would like to contribute and make this solution better, please go right ahead. If you feel this prohibits you from contributing, please create a bug report or enhancement request via the github issue tracker and I'll incorporate it when I have time/agree its a good idea.

Thanks.
